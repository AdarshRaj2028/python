# Sets is a collection of unordered items. Sets are mutable(Their elements are immutable)
# Each elements must be unique and immutable(Like Int, float, string, tuples, boolean...), Not elements which are mutable(Like Lists, Dict)
# You canâ€™t access elements using indexes like set[0]
# Internally, sets use hashing, which is why the order keeps changing
# Searching in sets is faster than lists (O(1) average time)
# Helpful in algorithms/DSA for checking repeated items quickly
